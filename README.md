This repository contains the frontend code for Signolingo, an American Sign Language (ASL) character learning application inspired by Duolingo. Signolingo is designed to help users learn ASL characters in an interactive and engaging way. Similar to Duolingo, users can progress through lessons, earn points, and track their learning journey. The application provides a user-friendly interface and intuitive learning experience.

## Features
